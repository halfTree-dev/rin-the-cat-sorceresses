# Prologue
Rin was once one of the 13th century’s most powerful sorceresses. Cursed by the Cat Witch Cauchy during a mission, she became a black cat of misfortune and was locked in Cauchy’s basement.

But Rin’s magic was strong. She broke the curse, mastering the cat’s bad luck. Now she can shift between human and cat forms, using the black cat’s misfortune to turn enemies’ attacks back on them.

Now, you must guide Rin. Help her escape Cauchy’s basement and defeat the evil Cat Witch.

# Story
For centuries, I have been perfecting my magic, turning my enemies into helpless creatures. My cats are loyal to me—I transform them to look like me, and together we create beautiful patterns of bullets that no one can escape.

When that foolish sorceress Rin came to stop me, she thought she was so powerful, so righteous. But I was smarter. I tricked her easily and cursed her into a black cat. Bad luck would follow her everywhere. I locked her in my basement, thinking she would give up and become just another pet.

But something went wrong. Rin didn't break like the others. She grew stronger, turning her misfortune into power. Now she fights back, deflecting my bullets and climbing through my floors. My cats report that she's getting closer.

I am not worried, though. I have been preparing for this moment. My basement is filled with traps, and my final spell is ready. When Rin reaches me, I will show her why I am called the Evil Cat Witch. This basement will be her tomb, and I will remain the queen of cats forever.
